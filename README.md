# ChromaDB_RAG_Extracting_and_Embedding_Data
Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using ChromaDB for vector storage and Hugging Face embeddings. The workflow walks through the full process of extracting, processing, and querying data from a real-world HTML business report of Nike.

# Overview:
The goal is to retrieve and embed key textual data from NIKE's Fiscal 2024 Q4 report and store it in a vector database. Once stored, we can semantically search the content using natural language queries.

# Key Components:
- HTML Data Extraction
- Text Chunking
- Embedding with HuggingFace
- Vector Storage with Chroma
- Semantic Search
